                A list is an abstract data type that describes a linear collection of data items in some order, in that each element occupies a specific position in the list.
                The order could be alphabetic or numeric or it could just be the order in which the list elements have been added. Unlike a set, the elements of a list do not
                need to be unique. The elements are accessed using an index with the starting position being 0.

                Lists are used in a wide variety of situations. Many of us use to-do lists to keep ourselves organised. You may use a shopping list to make sure you donâ€™t 
                forget to buy something when you visit the supermarket. If you use a streamed music service, you probably have several playlists.
